# Environmental Calculator
---
This project was created as part of a course (DAT257/DIT257- Agile software project management) taught at Chalmers University in 
collaboration with the University of Gothenburg. The primary motivateion behind the project was to learn to use Agile (and SCRUM) as a developer framework.

The program has a simple login feature and a simple database. Each user can input daily activities into the caluclator and receive feedback on how much CO2 they have produced
through these activities and view statistics on different graphs to see this better and compare themselves with where they should be.

Below is the loginpage for the program

Once logged in  you are greeted with a homescreen with some information about the application and the UN goal 13 as well as a navigation-bar at the top

In the Calculator section you will be able to log all the relevant activity data for your personal emissions, for example, food and personal transport. This can be seen here as 
personal transportation is logged.

And also the results gives an overview of the emissions as well as filtering options and total emission.

Finally one can view statistics over their emissions in the statistics tab.
