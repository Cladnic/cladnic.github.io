# Airline Booking System
---

This project was meant as a hobby project to learn more about Java, JavaFx and APIs. It is a small program with some interesting features. Threads are used to load API-data 
due to the large amount of data fetched so the program does not stutter. The data is airports around the world. One can select an airport they want to travel from and to as can be
seen in the picture

When selecting the airports one can also search for them and an autocomplete feature will suggest airports to chose from based on what is written.
